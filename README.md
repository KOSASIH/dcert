# DCert dapp on Pi

DCert on Pi network is a decentralized application that allows users to send, store and manage their certificates securely on the blockchain. It operates on a network of nodes, ensuring the creation and verification process is transparent, efficient, and tamper-proof. Users can access their certificates anytime, anywhere, this is the new way to celebrate success in a timeless manner.
